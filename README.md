You will require a program called `pdflatex` from the base install of the LaTeX package on your distribution.

For example, on Ubuntu 19:
```
sudo apt install texlive-latex-base
```

Then you'll also need our latex package dependencies, which I acquired with the command:
```
sudo apt install texlive-latex-recommended
```
